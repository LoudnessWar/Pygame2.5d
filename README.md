This is a work in progress example of a pygame iosmetric/2.5d perpective shader. The project uses Quadrilateral interpolation for projective interpolation. Right now there is a lot to do but in general it works
and I am happy with what I have so far.

#TODO
Better file systems for the project
Mouse Mapping
Anti Aliasing?
importable(probably not ;b)

⚠️⚠️⚠️
I decided to just make this public,
its still a work in progress but honestly.
The main thing would be maybe moving the transformation
matrix into python so then you can accuretly project your mouse onto the screen
if you are making a project that doesnt require a mouse and you want better
control of your screen and camera then what you are given through this is probably a good start.

Also its not really 2.5D this project is more like you can just control a plain that is the screen however you want
