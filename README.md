This is a work in progress example of a pygame iosmetric/2.5d perpective shader. The project uses Quadrilateral interpolation for projective interpolation. Right now there is a lot to do but in general it works
and I am happy with what I have so far.

#TODO
Better file systems for the project
Mouse Mapping
Anti Aliasing?
importable(probably not ;b)
